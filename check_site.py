"""Check a built site: every link resolves, and every book is reachable.

The site was one page for as long as it had one book per army. It is now an
overview, a page per army and the editions' shelf, cross-linked by relative
path, and a relative path is exactly the thing that breaks silently: a dead
href renders as a link, publishes as a link, and only fails when somebody
clicks it.

Two directions, because they catch different failures.

  - **Every link points at something.** A missing target is a 404 for a reader
    and nothing at all for the build.
  - **Every PDF is linked from somewhere.** A book that compiles, publishes and
    is named by no page has shipped into a corner of the site nobody can reach,
    which no link check going the other way would notice.

What it cannot see is a link that resolves to the *wrong* page - Lizardmen's
card pointing at the Skaven book is two correct files and one wrong sentence.
Nothing here reads meaning.
