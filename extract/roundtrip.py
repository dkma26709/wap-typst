"""Verify a rendered book carries every word its source does.

coverage.py compares the source PDF against the extracted JSON. This compares
against the *rendered* PDF instead, closing the loop end to end, and so it can
see what the JSON comparison cannot: an importer that emitted broken markup, a
mangled emphasis, a table that quietly lost a column.

Reading words back out of our own PDF needs two corrections, both learned the
hard way and both of which otherwise report perfect typesetting as loss:

  Soft hyphens. Typst hyphenates at a line break with U+00AD, which the
  tokeniser reads as a word boundary. Lizardmen alone breaks seven words that
  way, so the halves are rejoined across the break.

  Letter spacing. Display text carries `tracking`, and PDF text extraction
  injects a space wherever the tracked advance is wide enough - the Chaos
  Dwarfs ANIMOSITY heading comes back literally as 'ANIMOSI TY'. Words are
  therefore rebuilt from character positions with a gap threshold proportional
  to the font size, rather than trusting the spaces in the extracted text.

Note what this gate still cannot see: a word *changed* rather than lost, and any
punctuation at all. Both of the markup substitutions that had to be handled in
to_book.py - curled quotes and hyphen-becomes-minus - are invisible here.
