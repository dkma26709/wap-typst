"""Compare two renders glyph by glyph and report whether anything moved at all.

The stronger sibling of `render_text.py`. Where that one asks whether the books
still say the same words, this asks whether they still put every mark in the same
place: each character, its origin to a hundredth of a point, its size and its
font, page by page. Equality means the change was invisible on paper.

That is the check for a refactor that claims to be a pure restatement - a run of
primitives rewritten as one call, rendered through the same primitives underneath.
Text equality would pass such a change even if the layout shifted; this will not.

Use it where a claim is "nothing moved" and `render_text.py` where the claim is
"nothing was lost", since a deliberate layout change fails this one by design and
that is not a defect.

`cmp` on the PDFs themselves is not the instrument, and the reason is worth
knowing. Typst stamps a wall-clock `/CreationDate` into every file, so two renders
of the same commit on different days differ in bytes while being identical in
every way that matters - same size, same object count, one differing region. A
control that renders twice in quick succession passes, because both land in the
same second, which makes the trap easy to mistake for determinism.
`typst compile --creation-timestamp <unix>` pins it if byte-identity is what you
actually want.
