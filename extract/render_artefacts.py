"""Sweep rendered pages for Typst markup that leaked through onto the page.

Escaped markup survives into the PDF more readily than it should: a `#macro(`
that was meant to be called, a `*bold*` marker whose pair went missing, a `)[`
where a call was cut in half. The gates that count words cannot see any of it,
because a stray asterisk is not a lost word.

`--against` is the option that makes this usable. Several of these shapes occur
legitimately in the books - the asterisk that marks a common magic item, and the
footnote markers under a weapon table - so a bare run reports two dozen hits on
an untouched corpus and teaches you to ignore it. Given a baseline render, only
hits that are *new* are reported, which is the number that means something.

Measured on this corpus: `rulebook-proposal` carries 24 legitimate asterisks and
`dwarfs-house` and `daemons-of-chaos-house` one each, all footnote markers
present in their base books too.
