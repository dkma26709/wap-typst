"""Emit a whole book as hand-editable Typst.

The successor to the old to_typst.py, which wrote a content fragment full of
serialised run dictionaries for a generated wrapper to include. This writes the complete
book - front matter and all - as markup a person can read and extend, and once
it has run the file is the source of truth and this script is not involved again.

Escaping happens here, at import time, rather than at render time. That is what
retires the dictionary API: text out of a PDF is hostile, so the sigils are
escaped as the file is written, and thereafter the file is trusted because a
person owns it.

Layout decisions - two-column, shared pages, run-in chart labels - were carried
over from the script it replaced rather than rewritten, so an imported book
paginates exactly as the generated one did.
