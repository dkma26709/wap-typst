= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Hobgoblin army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Hobgoblin units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BACKSTABBERS", "")

A unit with this special rule that successfully restrains from pursuing after breaking an enemy unit in close combat causes D6 Strength 3 hits on the fleeing unit for every complete rank the Hobgoblin unit has (up to a maximum of 3). Resolve any casualties before moving the fleeing unit.

#namecost("COWARDLY DESPOILERS", "")

Models with this special rule gain +1 To Hit in the first round of combat if they successfully charge an enemy in the rear or flank.

#namecost("CUNNING RETREAT", "")

When an enemy unit declares to fire at a unit with this special rule in their Shooting phase, it may choose to make a Feigned Flight move directly away from the enemy unit shooting at it. Once the unit has completed its move, the enemy unit may continue with its shooting as declared (provided they are still in range).

#namecost("DED SHOOTY", "")

Mounted models with this special rule do not suffer penalties To Hit for Moving and Shooting and may Volley Fire even while moving. In addition, when using Fire and Flee, the unit can still use their Swiftstride special rule.

#namecost("HIIYAAARRGHH!", "")

If a model with this special rule is your Army General, then once per game he may call a Hiiyaaarrghh! The Hiiyaaarrghh! may only be called if the model first declares a charge, and must be announced immediately after making the charge declaration, before any charge reaction takes place. In the turn a Hiiyaaarrghh! is called, every friendly Hobgoblin unit within 12" add +D3" to their charge move this turn. The Army General himself, and any unit he joins, adds +D6 to their charge move instead. In addition, every friendly unit within 12" of the Army General add their rank bonus to the result rolled on the Treacherous Gits table (to a maximum of 6).

#namecost("QUELL TREACHERY", "")

Any friendly unit joined by a model with this special rule may re-roll failed Treachery tests.

#namecost("TREACHEROUS GITS", "")

Units with this special rule must test for Treachery in the Charge sub-phase after all normal charges has been declared during each of your turns, by every unit that is subject to Treachery, unless any of the following applies:

- The unit has less than 5 models.
- The unit has declared a charge this turn.
- The unit is engaged in close combat.
- The unit is garrisoning a building.
- The unit is fleeing or currently off the battlefield.

Roll a D6 for each eligible unit. If the dice roll is a 2 or more, the unit behaves normally this turn. If the roll is a 1, however, the unit has failed its Treachery test and must roll on the Treachery table below:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Traitor! If the unit is armed with missile
weapons, they will immediately resolve a
round of shooting against the nearest friendly
unit within Line of Sight. If the unit does not
have any missile weapons or if there are no
friendly units within Line of Sight, they will
inflict D3 Strength 3 Hits for every complete
rank the unit has on themselves instead (any
Wounds suffered will not cause a Panic test).
The unit may not move, shoot or cast spells
this turn."), ("2", "We'll get a better view from further back!
The unit must immediately take a Panic test.
If it's passed, the unit may not voluntarily
move this turn."), ("3-4", "We Stayz 'Ere! The unit may not voluntarily
move this turn."), ("5", "Bloody Murder! The unit suffers D3
Strength 3 Hits for every complete rank the
unit has (any Wounds suffered will not cause
a Panic test). The unit may move as normal
afterwards."), ("6", "Cut 'em good! Pivot the unit on the spot to
face the nearest visible enemy unit, and then
make a full normal move in a straight line
towards it. If there is no visible enemy, the
unit must move straight ahead instead. If it is
impossible for the unit to pivot to face the
closest enemy, it will pivot towards it as far
as it can, and will then move as far forward
as it can while still keeping the enemy within
its forward arc. After the move is complete
the unit must declare a charge against the
closest visible enemy unit, if it is possible to
do so. If the unit cannot declare a charge then
it may carry on with the rest of its turn
normally, as if it had not yet moved this turn.")))

#lore("LORE OF DA HIIYAAARRGHH!")[

#spell("SNEAKY STEALIN'", "Lore Attribute")[When a Spell of da Little Waaagh! is successfully cast, and after its effects have been resolved, roll a D6. On a 6 you may take one dispel dice from the opponent's dispel pool and add it to your power pool. If there are no dice left in the opponent's dispel pool, then this lore attribute has no effect.]

#spell("VINDICTIVE GLARE", "Signature Spell", cast: "6+")[_Vindictive Glare_ is a *magic missile* with a range of 24" and causes 2D6 Strength 3 hits.]

#spell("OI! GERROFF!", 1, cast: "5+")[_Oi! Gerroff!_ is a *magic missile* with a range of 18". The target is 'pushed' 2D3" directly away from the caster (it does not change facing).

#spell("SNEAKY STABBIN'", 1, cast: "5+")[_Sneaky Stabbin'_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 24" that targets Hobgoblins. The target unit's close combat attacks have the Armour Piercing (1) special rule until the start of the caster's next Magic phase.

#spell("BRAIN BURSTA", 1, cast: "6+")[_Brain Bursta_ is a *direct damage* spell with a range of 18" that targets a single enemy model (even a character in a unit). The target suffers a Strength 5 hit.]

#spell("NIKKIT! NIKKIT!", 4, cast: "11+")[_Nikkit! Nikkit!_ is a *direct damage* spell with a range of 12" that targets a single enemy character (even a character in a unit). If the target has one or more magic items, randomly select one of them and roll a D6 – that item is stolen on a 3+. If the caster does not already have a magic item of this type they can now use it, otherwise it is destroyed. In addition, the target suffers D3 Strength 4 Hits which Ignores Armour Saves.]

#spell("THE GREAT GREEN SPITE", 4, cast: "12+")[_The Great Green Spite_ is a *direct damage* spell with a range of 24".

*Armour (4+).*

- *Death From Below:* The Dread Maw has the Ambushers special rule, with the following exception. When it enters the battle in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, it does not move onto the board as reinforcements in the normal way. Instead, when a Dread Maw enters the battle, place a small marker anywhere on the battlefield, but not in impassable terrain or within 1" of a deployed unit.

Roll a scatter dice and an artillery dice. If you roll a Hit on the scatter dice, the marker stays in place. If you roll an arrow, move the marker the number, in inches, indicated by the artillery dice in the direction shown. If the marker is under a friendly unit, impassable terrain or a building, place it 1" away from the closest edge of the unit/terrain.

Once the final position of the marker is established, place the emerging Dread Maw such that it touches the marker, facing any direction. If the marker is under an enemy unit, you may place your Dread Maw into base contact with the enemy unit in their front arc; the Dread Maw will counts as charging this turn.

If you roll a misfire, or if for any reason some of the models in the unit cannot be placed, then the unit does not emerge this turn. You may roll for it to appear again the next turn.

  equipment: "Hand weapon",
  special-rules: "Immunity (Psychology), Natural Armour (6+), Stubborn",
  special-rules-body: [
- *Fall Over:* A Giant must test to see whether it falls over if any of the following apply:
  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Large Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2", "Jump Up and Down"), ("3", "Pick Up and..."), ("4-6", "Swing with Club")))

*BIG THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monsters, Monstrous Creatures, Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots, War Machines, and Shrines._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-4", "Thump with Club"), ("5-6", "'Eadbutt")))

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will instead use the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice). The Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Stuff into Bag: The model is effectively removed as a casualty and can do nothing whilst in the
bag, but if the Giant should be slain, any enemy trapped in its bag are freed at the end of the
battle, and no longer counts as casualties."), ("2", "Throw Back into Combat: The victim is hurled into its own unit like a living missile. The

treat this as a Throw Back into Combat result instead."), ("4-5", "Squash or Eat: The model is removed as a casualty."), ("6", "Pick Another: Treat the attack as if the Giant had rolled the Stuff into Bag result, above, and
