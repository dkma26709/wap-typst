= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#columns(2)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Wood Elf army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the Warhammer rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules' that apply to several Wood Elf units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("AMBUSH FROM THE WORLDROOTS", "")

A Wood Elf army can always place an additional forest no more than 12" in diameter on the battlefield. This is done during deployment, before any units are deployed, and must be placed wholly in your half of the battlefield. Declare which type of forest it is when you place it. If you cannot fit the forest on your half of the table, move other terrain features by the shortest distance necessary so that the forest can be placed. If you still cannot place the forest, or if the scenario means that the Wood Elf army does not have a table half in which to deploy, this additional forest is not used in this battle.

#namecost("ASRAI ARCHERY", "")

Models with this rule do not suffer the normal \-1 To Hit penalty for moving and shooting.

#namecost("BLESSINGS OF THE ANCIENTS", "")

A Wizard that has this rule and is within 6" of a forest gains a +1 casting and dispel bonus.

Models with this rule have the Dodge (6+) special rule in close combat. However, this cannot be used against enemies that attack before the model with Elven Grace.

#namecost("ENCHANTED ARROWS", "")

Some models in the Wood Elf army have the option to purchase enchanted arrows. If a model has enchanted arrows, they must use them when shooting with Elven shortbows or longbows. Note that a model can only have one kind of Enchanted Arrows.

#namecost("SHADOW DANCES OF LOEC", "")

All models in the same unit must choose the same Shadow Dance. The effect of each Shadow Dance lasts until the end of that turn or until a new Shadow Dance is chosen. Models cannot choose the same Shadow Dance in two consecutive rounds of combat.
