= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Kingdoms of Ind army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Kingdoms of Ind units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("DEVA", "")

Models with this special rule have the Fear, Independent, Magical Attacks, Magical Ward (5+) and Unbreakable special rules.

If a unit of Devas loses a round of close combat it must take an Instability test. This works like a normal Break test, except that for every point they fail the test by, the unit suffers one additional Wound with no saves allowed. The Instability test can be tested on unmodified Leadership if the unit is Stubborn or Steadfast as normal.

#namecost("KARMA", "")

A unit with this special rule can benefit from either Good Karma or Bad Karma depending on their actions during the game. If a unit has Good Karma and receives Bad Karma or vice versa, the effects cancel each other out.

- *Good Karma:* If the unit successfully destroys, breaks or panics an enemy unit, all models in it may re-roll 1's To Hit and To Wound in close combat and with missile weapons until they suffer Bad Karma.

- *Bad Karma:* If the unit breaks from combat or flees as a result of a Panic test, all models in it must re-roll 6's To Hit and To Wound in close combat and with missile weapons until they gain Good Karma.

= MAGIC ITEMS
