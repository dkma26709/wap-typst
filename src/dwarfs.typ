Once a model with this runic tattoo is reduced to their last Wound, they gain the Magical Ward (3+) special rule against any further wounds suffered. However, at the end of the battle, a model with this runic tattoo that has been slain is worth no Victory Points. If it is still alive, the enemy player wins a bonus number of Victory Points equal to 100% of its points cost.

#namecost("RUNE OF ENDLESS BATTLE", "25 points")

During a turn in which a model with this runic tattoo charged, every attack it makes that causes an unsaved Wound allows it to immediately make one additional attack. This does not generate additional attacks.

#namecost("RUNE OF GRIT", "20 points")

A model with this runic tattoo gains +1 Toughness.

When they enter the battle in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, they do not move onto the board as reinforcements in the normal way. Instead, when a unit of Miners enters the battle, place a small marker (no more than 1" in diameter) anywhere on the battlefield, but not in impassable terrain or within 1" of a deployed unit.

Roll a scatter dice and an artillery dice. If you roll a Hit on the scatter dice, the marker stays in place. If you roll an arrow, move the marker the number, in inches, indicated by the artillery dice in the direction shown. If the marker is under a friendly unit, impassable terrain or a building, place it 1" away from the closest edge of the unit/terrain.

Once the final position of the marker is established, place the emerging unit in a legal formation such that it touches the marker, facing any direction. If the marker is under an enemy unit, you may place your unit into base contact with the enemy unit in their front arc; your unit will counts as charging this turn.

If you roll a misfire, or if for any reason some of the models in the unit cannot be placed, then the unit does not emerge. Instead, remove the marker and roll on the Underground Mishap table. If a unit emerges successfully, it may act normally this turn.

If you have several units of Miners, then repeat this process, one unit at a time.

- *Grombrindal has no Fear!:* Grombrindal is Unbreakable. If his unit flees for any reason he will always stand his ground. If the unit was engaged in combat, he will continue to fight while his unit flees, denying the foe the chance to pursue. Grombrindal can even join a unit that does not have the Unbreakable special rule – this is an exception to the normal Unbreakable rules.
