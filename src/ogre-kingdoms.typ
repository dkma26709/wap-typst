= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#columns(2)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Ogre Kingdoms army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Ogre Kingdoms units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BENEATH CONTEMPT", "")

Gnoblars have the Expendable special rule. In addition, even other Gnoblars treat them as being Expendable.

#namecost("BICKER", "")

Roll a D6 at the beginning of each of your turns for each unit with this special rule that is not in combat or fleeing and has a Unit Strength of 5 or more. If a unit rolls a 1 it may not move in the Movement phase or shoot in the Shooting phase this turn.

#namecost("OGRE CHARGE", "")

Each model on foot with the Ogre Charge special rule that successfully charges an enemy has the Impact Hits (1) special rule. In addition, they add their current Rank Bonus to the Strength of the Impact Hits they inflict. In addition, they count as having one more rank than their actual number for the purpose of determining Steadfast in any turn that they charge.

#namecost("BLOOD VULTURE", "")

A blood vulture is treated as a missile weapon with the following profile:

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("24\"", "4", "Sniper"))

Rather than rolling to Hit using Ballistic Skill, the target must pass a Weapon Skill test to avoid being Hit.

#namecost("CHAINTRAP", "")

A chaintrap has the following profile:

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("6/9\"", "6", "Killing Blow, Quick Shot"))

#namecost("IMPALE", "")

A mount with this special rule has the Mighty Blow (1) special rule in any turn that it charges.

Buckler. If a model with an ironfist rolls a natural 6 when making a Parry save, it automatically inflicts an extra Hit back onto the model or unit that struck the blow.

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("28/42\"", "5", "Multiple Wounds (D3), Ponderous"))

#namecost("SWORD-GNOBLAR", "")

One use only. After attempting to cast a spell from the Lore of the Great Maw, a Butcher with a Tooth- Gnoblar may choose to sacrifice one to get +1 to his casting value.

#namecost("LOOK-OUT GNOBLAR", "")

Any character in a unit with a Look-out Gnoblar benefits from the 'Look Out Sir!' special rule as long as there are three rank and file models of the same troop type remaining in the unit.

#namecost("NAME-GNOBLAR", "")

For each Name-Gnoblar an Ogre has, he can choose an additional Big Name.

#namecost("SCALP-GNOBLAR", "")

#magic-item-chapter(intro: [This section contains the rules for some of the most iconic and powerful magical artefacts used by the Ogres. These may be used in addition to the magic items found in the Warhammer rulebook.])

Roll To Hit against the highest Weapon Skill amongst the enemy models in base contact. If the Thundercrush Attack hits, place the small template anywhere so that it is touching the wielder's base. Any infantry, war beasts or swarm models that lie underneath the template suffer a single Strength 3 hit.

A Siegebreaker Attack inflicts D6 hits with a Strength equal to the height of the building in inches, up to a maximum Strength of 10 (so, for example, models in a building that is 6 inches high would suffer D6 Strength 6 hits).

#magic-armour("GREEDY FIST", 35, type: "Ironfist")[The wearer gains +1 Strength and a Magical Ward (6+). If a Magic Weapon inflicts a Wound that is saved by the model's Parry save, it is then treated as a normal, non-magical weapon of the same type for the remainder of the game. In addition, an enemy Wizard loses a Wizard level and a randomly selected spell each time they suffer an unsaved Wound by an Ogre wearing the Greedy Fist.]

#magic-armour("MASTODON ARMOUR", 30, type: "Light armour")[If the wearer is killed by an attack that is not made in close combat, roll a D6; on a 2+, they will remain in play with one Wound remaining.]

]

#magic-item-section("talisman")[
#talisman("GNOBLAR THIEFSTONE", 30)[A Gnoblar Thiefstone grants the bearer Magic Resistance (1). In addition, roll on the following table when the model is deployed to see if the Thiefstone has helped them to 'find' any useful items. Note that this may result in the bearer of the Thiefstone having two or more Talismans. In addition, if a character is killed in close combat while being in base contact with the model wearing the Thiefstone, you will automatically be allowed to pick up any one Magic Item (except Magic Standards) that the slain character might have had, as long as the bearer does not already have a magic item of that type. The model with the Thiefstone may then use that item itself for the rest of the battle.

- *Fall Over:* A Giant must test to see whether it falls over if any of the following apply:
  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Large Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms. _*D6 Result* 1 Yell and Bawl 2 Jump Up and Down 3 Pick Up and\.\.\. 4\-6 Flail with Chain

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-4", "Throttle with Chain"), ("5-6", "'Eadbutt")))

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim suffers one or more unsaved Wounds, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Flail with Chain:* The Giant inflicts D6 Hits this round. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Otherwise, it will attack using the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Throttle with Chain:* Both the Slave Giant and the target roll a D6 and add their respective Strength values. If the Slave Giant's roll is higher than the target's, the target suffers D6 Wounds which Ignore Armour Saves. If the Slave Giant's roll is 1 during the roll-off, they cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice). The Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:
