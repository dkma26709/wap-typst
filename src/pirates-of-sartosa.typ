= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Pirates of Sartosa army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Pirates of Sartosa units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("DIRTY FIGHTING", "")

All models with this special rule gain +1 To Hit in the first round of close combat.

#namecost("MASTERS AND IDLERS", "")

Masters and Idlers are upgrades for certain units, follow the rules for normal Command Group models. You may have one Master and Idler of each sort for every Pirate Captain or Pirate Lord in your army.

- *Bosun:* A unit with a Bosun gains the Cold-Blooded special rule.

- *Look-Out:* A character within 6" of a unit with a Look-Out may re-roll failed "Look out, Sir!" tests, and characters in the unit may use the rule even if they are below 5 models.

- *Master Gunner:* A unit with a Master Gunner joined can re-roll 1's when rolling To Hit with blunderbusses, handguns and pistols. If he is part of a War Machine crew, that war machine may re-roll one Artillery Dice per game.

- *Pilot:* A unit with a Pilot gains the Ambushers special rule.

#namecost("NAVAL BOMBARDMENT", "")

Once per game, you may fire D3 Cannon shots in the shooting phase from the edge of your deployment zone for every full 1000 points of game size you are playing. Each shot is fired from a separate point within a 45° angle no more than 3" apart from each other, and with a Line of Sight value of 3. If a Misfire is rolled, count the result as a "May not Shoot".

#namecost("RACIAL DISTRUST", "")

Most models belong to a certain race as detailed in their Troop Type. This includes Human, Dwarf, Ogre and Orc. Characters may only join units belonging to the same race.

#namecost("SEA LEGS", "")

All models with this special rule may re-roll failed Dangerous Terrain tests.

#namecost("HARPOON LAUNCHER", "")

_Blood in the Water_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 18".

#namecost("COUNTER-CURRENT", "")
#namecost("Level 1 Cast on 5+", "")

#namecost("WATERY GRAVE", "")
#namecost("Level 3 Cast on 9+", "")

_Watery Grave_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24". The target unit counts as moving through dangerous terrain until the start of the caster's next Magic phase. For every 4" the unit moves while the spell is in effect, the chance of them failing the test increases by +1.

#namecost("VORPAL MAELSTROM", "")
#namecost("Level 4 Cast on 13+", "")

_Vorpal Maelstrom_ is a *direct damage* spell. Place the large template anywhere within 18" of the Wizard; it then scatters D6".
