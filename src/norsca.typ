= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Norscan army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Norscan units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BLOOD RAGE", "")

Whenever a model with this special rule makes a successful charge (including Counter-Charge, Pursuit and Overrun), they are subject to Frenzy in the following round of close combat and count each of their ranks as double for the purpose of Steadfast.

#namecost("FUR CLOAK", "")

A fur cloak gives the wearer the Natural Armour (6+) special rule against missile attacks.

= SAGAS

*Certain characters in the Norscan army can choose one of the Sagas on this page, as detailed in the army list. No Saga may be taken more than once per army (excluding Special Characters).*

#namecost("SAGA OF THE FEARLESS LEADER", "35 points")

The character and any unit they are with have the Cold- Blooded special rule.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE EVER-VIGILANT", "30 points")

Model on foot with shield only. The character gains the Parry (6+) special rule, and enemies suffer \-1 To Hit the model in close combat.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE RELENTLESS", "")
#namecost("WARRIOR", "30 points")

The character gains +1 Attack for every enemy model in base contact with them when it is their turn to strike, up to a maximum of +3.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE SHINING HERO", "25 points")

The model gains the Inspiring Presence (6) special rule.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE BEASTSLAYER", "20 points")

The model gains Immunity (Terror). In addition, they gain +1 To Hit and To Wound when fighting War Beasts, Monstrous Beasts or Monsters in close combat.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE ETERNAL WARRIOR", "20 points")

Once this model is reduced to 0 Wounds, roll a D6; on a 4+ the model remains fighting with 1 Wound. This has no effect against Killing Blow or other attacks that would instantly kill the model.

#namecost("SAGA OF THE GLORIOUS HUNTER", "15 points")

Model on foot only. After deployment, but before the first turn begins, select a single character or monster in your opponent’s army. This is the character’s primary quarry. The character may re-roll all failed To Hit and To Wound rolls against his primary quarry in close combat and with missile attacks.

- *The Ravens*: Each of the two Ravens gives the Ravenswyrd an additional Attack that are resolved at Weapon Skill 3 and Strength 3. These attacks do not benefit from any bonuses or Magic Weapons.

If the Ravenswyrd is wounded, roll a D6 for each wound suffered. On a 2+, the Ravenswyrd may ignore the wound and reduce his Strength, Toughness or Attacks by 1 instead. On a 1, one of his Ravens are slain instead. If both Ravens are killed then the Ravenswyrd will also die and is removed from the table.

In addition, roll a D6 at beginning of the Norse turn. On a roll of a 6 the Ravenswyrd may increase his Strength, Toughness or Attacks by 1. This increase may not take it above the Ravenwyrd's starting characteristics.

  notes: [
- The Ravenswyrd may never be the Army General.
