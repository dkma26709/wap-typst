= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Araby army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the Warhammer rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules' that apply to several Araby units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("TACTICAL WITHDRAWAL", "")

Models with this rule may re-roll the lowest dice roll for their flee distance when choosing Flee as a charge reaction.

#namecost("ZEALOTRY", "")

Units with this rule counts as having one rank more than they actually have when determining if they are Steadfast. In addition, they have the Cold-blooded special rule for any Break tests taken in the first round of combat.

- *The Eye Pendant:* Talisman. The Eye Pendant gives Abdul a Magical Ward (4+). In addition, any model with the Undead special rule wishing to attack Abdul must first pass a Leadership test. If failed, that model may not attack this round.
- *The Necronomicon:* Arcane Item. This item gives the bearer the Loremaster (Lore of Death) special rule, and gives them knowledge of all spells in their chosen Lore regardless of Wizard Level. In addition, the bearer may re-roll any 1's when casting spells. However, every time he successfully casts a spell, he must pass a Leadership test. If he fails the test and the result is an even number, Abdul counts as having failed a Stupidity test. If he fails the test and the result is an odd number, Abdul suffers a Wound with no saves allowed. In addition, any unit joined by Abdul suffers \-1 to its Leadership value.

#field("OPTIONS", "")

- May be accompanied by a Genie +85 points

#field("SPECIAL RULES", "Immunity (Psychology), Tactical Withdrawal, Zealotry")

- *Genie Master:* Abdul may re-roll failed Leadership tests when trying to summon Genies.
- *Mad Magus*: Before Abdul attempts to cast any spell besides the Lore's Signature spell, you must first roll 2D6 and refer to the spell order in the Lore of Death to determine which spell he may cast at this time. This can allow him to cast the same spell several times in the same Magic phase. The resulting spell is otherwise cast as normal. In addition, Abdul may never be the Army General, nor may any unit he joins use his Leadership.

#field("SPECIAL RULES", "Hidden, Tactical Withdrawal")

- *Acrobat:* Kassim has the Obstacle Strider special rule and can move over solid impassable terrain such as walls, rock formations or buildings, but not water and the like. In close combat, all successful hits against him must be re-rolled. At the end of each combat he is in, before break tests are taken, he may choose to leave his unit and move out of combat. Place him anywhere within 1" his unit. He may move as normal in his next turn.
- *Master Thief:* If Kassim is in base contact with an enemy character or champion with magic items, he may attempt to steal them. Roll a D6 at the start of each combat phase: on a 4+, Kassim successfully steals one random Talisman, Enchanted or Arcane item from the character. The item is then removed from play. Any items stolen are worth their cost in additional Victory Points, even if Kassim is removed as a casualty later in the game.
